- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylorwilkersonoliver
- 👀 I’m interested in: security, automation, robotics, ai, off-grid camping tech, minimalist hiking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C#, Java, Unity3D, morse code, studying for my Amateur Extra HAM radio license
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: anything a senior dev isn't going to tell me is beyond their capability so I can be relatable at job interviews.
